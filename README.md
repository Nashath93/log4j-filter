# log4j-filter
The Sample Project is all about filtering different log levels in to different log files. Itâ€™s easy to implement using Log4j framework in java using LevelMatchFilter class and DenyAllFilter class. Project: First I have configured log4j.xml file for different appenders. For this I used a Filter called LevelMatchFilter and DenyAllFilter inside the appender. This configuration file will create different locations to store Error Messages, Info Messages, Fatal Messages, Warning Messages and Debug Messages. See the below image. I have attached the maven project file. Run the project and see.
